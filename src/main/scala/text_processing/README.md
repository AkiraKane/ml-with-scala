# Text processing

## Training
We start from removing non-words, punctuation and stop-words.
Ð¦e can compute the similarity between two documents. Using TF-IDF, we have 
transformed each document into a vector representation. The closer two 
vectors are the more similar they are.
  
## Input data
We use a text dataset called 20 Newsgroups; this dataset is commonly used 
for text-classification tasks.
