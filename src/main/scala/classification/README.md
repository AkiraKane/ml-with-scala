# Classification

## Explanation

## Input data
This example uses a dataset from a competition on Kaggle. 
The dataset was provided by StumbleUpon, and the problem relates to classifying 
whether a given web page is ephemeral (that is, short lived and will cease 
being popular soon) or evergreen (that is, persistently popular) on their 
web content recommendation pages.
