# Regression

## Intro
Regression models are concerned with target variables that can take any real value.
The underlying principle is very similarâ€”we wish to  nd a model that maps 
input features to predicted target variables.
Spark's MLlib library offers two broad classes of regression models: linear models 
and decision tree regression models.


## Input data
We use the bike sharing dataset. This dataset contains hourly records of 
the number of bicycle rentals in the capital bike sharing system. It also 
contains variables related to date and time, weather, and seasonal and holiday information.
The dataset is available at [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset)
